# Voice Integration
This is a RimWorld mod intended for use with VoiceAttack or similar software. It can trigger events using the Numpad/Keypad -- attach these buttons to specific words in VoiceAttack.  
  
Events are usually negative, and as such should be attached to uncommon but not rare phrases, such as the initial reaction to a random event like Cold Snap.  
  
For example:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A **_raid_** would ruin everything right now."  
will trigger a raid upon the word "raid" being said, as long as you've set up that keyword in VoiceAttack.  
  
### Main branch _should_ always be stable. Download and it's yours to tweak or use at your own will.
